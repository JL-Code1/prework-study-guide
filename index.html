        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Hyper Text Markup Language, HTML, is a programing languague used to set the structure. 
            </li>
          <li> The HTML is primarily structured in a "head", "body", and "footer", which makes it an easy concept to understand the basic foundation. 
            </li>
          <li>You can think of the HTML as the frame or the structure of the webpage.
            </li>
          <li> This is where all the information that is for the user is store, but not all the information 
               stored is visible to the user. 
            </li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> This is where you start to design how the webpage will look to the user.
            </li>
          <li> All of your font size, coloring, spacing and styling the layout will be done here.  
            </li>
          <li> There are three different styling methods you can get your design from inline CSS, internal 
               CSS style sheet and an external style sheet.
            </li>
          <li> The type of method you use is going to depend on the specific project you are working on.
               Each will have its own pros and cons with each application.

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript tackles the more technical aspects on the webpage.
              </li>
            <li>This is where you build the dynamic behaviors in the webpage.
              </li>
            <li>Where HTML and CSS the coder told the computer "what" to do, JavaScript is essentially telling
              the computer "how" you want it do certain tasks. 
              </li>
            <li>JavaScript will knows how to do alot but it needs to be told very specifically what you 
                need it to do.
